2. The game will select a random number between the lower bound and the upper bound that the player enters.
3. You will be prompted to guess the number.
4. Enter your guess and press Enter.
5. The game will tell you if your guess is higher or lower than the correct answer.
6. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.

## Features
